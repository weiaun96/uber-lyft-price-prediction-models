Doing price prediction for Uber and Lyft rides by using R

- This project was done as an academic assignment to create machine learning models by using Rstudio. With an interest in the technology of ride-sharing, I chose a dataset from Kaggle to build the models in an effort to predict prices for Uber rides. The project report is also included in the repository.
- The dataset is retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices).
